# UI clone of Ochi design

- I used LocomotiveJs to add a smooth scroll effect and to implement parallax effect i.e. the background content is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.

- ScrollTrigger to detect when a particular element is visible on screen, to pin a section and animate it using GSAP.

- Text reveal, button and header animations are done using GSAP.

- Steps to follow: 

    - npm install
    - npm run dev
